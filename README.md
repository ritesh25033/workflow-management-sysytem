Step 1: Setup and Planning
Project Setup:

Create a new React project using Create React App (CRA) or Vite.

Install necessary dependencies like react-router-dom for routing and axios for API calls.

Authentication Setup:

Choose an authentication method (e.g., Firebase Authentication or a simple JWT-based login).

Implement basic login functionality with form validation and authentication logic.

Review Figma Design:

Identify UI components needed for the workflow listing and editor.

Plan how to implement these components in React.

Flowchart Library Selection:

Choose a suitable flowchart library such as React Flow or JointJS.

Consider the features needed for the workflow editor (e.g., drag-and-drop, node customization).

API Integration:

Set up API integration using the mock APIs provided by Beeceptor.

Define API endpoints for workflow listing, creation, and editing.

Step 2: Implement Core Features
User Authentication
Login Form: Create a basic login form with input fields for username and password.

Validation: Implement form validation to ensure valid input.

Authentication Logic: Use the chosen authentication method to authenticate users.

Workflow Listing
API Call: Fetch workflows from the mock API.

Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to filter workflows by name or description.

Status Indicators: Display status indicators (e.g., active, completed) for each workflow.

Workflow Editor
Flowchart Integration: Integrate the chosen flowchart library into the editor.

Node and Link Management: Allow users to add, remove, and connect nodes.

Save and Load Workflows: Implement functionality to save and load workflows from the API.

Step 3: UI & State Management
State Management
Context API or Zustand: Use a state management library to handle global state (e.g., user authentication status, workflow data).

Redux or MobX: Alternatively, consider using Redux or MobX for more complex state management needs.

UI Responsiveness and Theme Consistency
CSS Framework: Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material UI to ensure responsiveness and theme consistency with the Figma design.

Responsive Components: Ensure all UI components are responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
